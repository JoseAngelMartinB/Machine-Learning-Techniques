## 1. Load the data asigned
Observing the data file, we have decided to obtain the necesarry data from it 
without changing the original file. A filter is going to be used in order to 
obtain the data correspondig to San Juan city between January 1990 and January
1996.

The first 4 coloums of the data file are only used for identifying the direfent
data records, therefore, they have not been used as features. Some rows do not
include all the data, consecuently, a zero value has been inserted in that 
features.
